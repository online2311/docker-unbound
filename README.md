```

## Volumes

* `/config`: Additional [configuration](#configuration) files

## Ports

* `53/tcp 53/udp`: DNS listening port

## Usage

### Docker Compose

Docker compose is the recommended way to run this image. You can use the
following [docker compose template](examples/compose/docker-compose.yml), then
run the container:

```shell
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```

### Command line

You can also use the following minimal command:

```shell
docker run -d -p 53:53 -p 53:53/udp --name unbound nodecloud/unbound
```

## Upgrade

Recreate the container whenever I push an update:

```shell
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Notes

### Configuration

When Unbound is started the main configuration [/etc/unbound/unbound.conf](rootfs/etc/unbound/unbound.conf)
is imported.

If you want to override settings from the main configuration you have to create
config files (with `.conf` extension) in `/config` folder.

For example, you can set up [forwarding queries](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/#forward-host)
to the appropriate public DNS server for queries that cannot be answered by
this server using a new configuration named `/config/forward-records.conf`:

```text
forward-zone:
  name: "."
  forward-tls-upstream: yes

  # cloudflare-dns.com
  forward-addr: 1.1.1.1@853
  forward-addr: 1.0.0.1@853
  #forward-addr: 2606:4700:4700::1111@853
  #forward-addr: 2606:4700:4700::1001@853
```

A complete documentation about Ubound configuration can be found on
NLnet Labs website: https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/

> **Warning**

> Container has to be restarted to propagate changes

### Root trust store

This image already embeds a root trust anchor to perform DNSSEC validation.

If you want to generate a new key, you can use [`unbound-anchor`](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound-anchor/)
which is available in this image:

```shell
docker run -t --rm --entrypoint "" -v "$(pwd):/trust-anchor" nodecloud/unbound:latest \
  unbound-anchor -v -a "/trust-anchor/root.key"
```

If you want to use your own root trust anchor, you can create a new config file
called for example `/config/00-trust-anchor.conf`:

```text
  auto-trust-anchor-file: "/root.key"
```

> **Note**
> 
> See [documentation](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/#auto-trust-anchor-file)
> for more info about `auto-trust-anchor-file` setting.

And bind mount the key:

```yaml
services:
  unbound:
    image: nodecloud/unbound
    container_name: unbound
    ports:
      - 53:53
      - 53:53/udp
    volumes:
      - "./config:/config"
      - "./root.key:/root.key"
    restart: always
```

### External backend DB as auxiliary cache

The cache DB module is already configured in the [module-config](rootfs/etc/unbound/unbound.conf)
directive and compiled into the daemon.

You just need to create a new Redis service with [persistent storage](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/redis#start-with-persistent-storage)
enabled in your compose file along the Unbound one.

```yaml
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:6-alpine
    container_name: unbound-redis
    command: redis-server --save 60 1
    volumes:
      - "./redis:/data"
    restart: always

  unbound:
    image: nodecloud/unbound
    container_name: unbound
    depends_on:
      - redis
    ports:
      - 53:53
      - 53:53/udp
    volumes:
      - "./config:/config:ro"
    restart: always
```

And declare the backend configuration to use this Redis instance in `/config`
like `/config/cachedb.conf`:

```text
cachedb:
  backend: "redis"
  secret-seed: "default"
  redis-server-host: redis
  redis-server-port: 6379
```
